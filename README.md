# GetSimple - URI Redirect Plus
GetSimple CMS plugin. Redirect URIs to internal or external pages (with '301 Moved Permanently' header). Also view the count and date of last redirection for each redirect.

## Version 0.2.2 Changes
* Imports redirect list from predecessor plugin on initial view, if available (see Earlier Versions)
* Select drop box for internal pages now sorts by parent then page title
* Added ability to redirect to external pages (i.e., other sites)
* Removed 'Incoming URI' and 'Redirect Page' terminology in favor of 'From' and 'To'
* Added redirect count and date of last redirection for each redirect
* Added multilingual support via the required I18N plugin (currently only English and Danish)

Note: For space reasons, long external destination URLs have their HTTP and WWW removed, as well as having their middle text removed, i.e., [example.com/...clste/wnerqylba](http://www.example.com/rtpfdwiHclste/wnerqylba "http://www.example.com/rtpfdwiHclste/wnerqylba"). You can see the full URL by mousing over the truncated external URLs.

## Earlier versions
This plugin is a successor to the no-longer-updated [original URI Redirect plugin](http://get-simple.info/extend/plugin/uri-redirect/150/) by Nathan Friemel (NathanF). Version numbering is continuing from where that earlier plugin left off (version 0.2.1).
